# Titan
This is the repository for the Titan programming language.

Titan is a functional concatenative programming language inspired by Joy, BQN, and FP. It utilizes a dynamic and strong type system alongside all of this.

## Building
You must have `make` and a C++20 compatible compiler installed on your machine. Finally:

```
make
```

The compiled binary should be in the current working directory.

## Cheat Sheet
Titan's cheat sheet is a work in progress, but you can find it [here](docs/CHEATSHEET.md).

## Documentation
Work in progress docs are available [here](docs/HUB.md).
