# Titan
This is the repository for the Titan programming language.

Titan is a functional concatenative programming language inspired by Joy, BQN, and FP. It utilizes a dynamic and strong type system alongside all of this.

## Building
You must have [dub](https://github.com/dlang/dub) and a D compiler installed on your machine. [LDC](https://github.com/ldc-developers/ldc) is recommended but is not required as other compilers work as well. Finally:

```
dub build --build=release
```

The compiled binary should be in the current working directory.

## Cheat Sheet
Titan's cheat sheet is a work in progress, but you can find it [here](docs/CHEATSHEET.md).

## Documentation
Work in progress docs are available [here](docs/HUB.md).
